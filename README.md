# NumaBot: The perfect Discord bot for UAFS students
This project is a fun and simple Discord bot I started working on the summer before my first semester at UAFS. It is open-source and all are welcomed to contribute to it.
I am hoping to turn this into a React Native application if I have the time and finish most of the features I want to add to the bot.

This is developed by yours truly, Christian Rawley. You can email me at christianrawley0@gmail.com (personal) or crawle00@uafs.edu (university).
